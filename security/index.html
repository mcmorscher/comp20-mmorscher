    <h1>Security Assessment of stark-castle-33112</h1>
    <h5>Michael Morscher</h5>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>My name is Michael Morscher, expert cybersecurity consultant specializing in penetration testing. I was hired by Jeremy Batchelder to perform an analysis of his Historic Landmarks program, consisting of a client-facing graphic interface and a server-side application with its own primitive interface. In this report, I will be researching and documenting security vulnerabilities in these applications, as well as providing recommendations to resolve them.</p>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>My testing methodology consisted of: </p>
    <li>"Black box" testing of the web interfaces to check for potential attacks</li>
    <li>Manual review of source code and subsequent "white box" testing of less obvious attacks</li>
    <li>Use of the curl tool for data transfer</li>
    <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
    <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <!-- TEMP -->
    <h3>Issues Found</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            <h4>Information Exposure</h4>
            <p>Location: stark-castle-33112.herokuapp.com/checkins.json</p>
            <p>Severity: Medium. The data being exposed through the checkins.json module is only the login, not any user passwords, but this is still a bad practice.</p>
            <p>Description: The issue was found during routine black box testing, following the specification of the module. To retrieve one's checkin data, they must enter their login via the query string, which then remains exposed. The information will remain in unsecured browser history and cache as well, representing a persistent threat.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Resolution: I recommend use of the HTTP POST method in place of using HTTP GET, which would allow entry of login through a form, and would allow processing of the response without exposing the login in the URL.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cross-Site Scripting</h4>
            <p>Location: index.js</p>
            <p>Severity: High. This security vulnerability allows for complete hijacking of the website.</p>
            <p>Description: Upon review of the index.js source code, it was noticed that no input validation was being done in the POST /sendLocation API. This means that when a user enters correctly formatted input in the form of an executable script, such as for their "login" value, the script will actually execute when the page loads and the HTML is read for display. Moreover, since the index page displays all checkins to all users, any user accessing the site after this attack is executed will be a victim.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Resolution: I strongly recommend performing input validation at line 29 of index.js to remove special characters associated with scripting, such as '&lt;', '&gt;', '=', and '/'. This would prevent cross-site scripting from being able to occur.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The security vulnerabilities outlined above can potentially destroy the intended functionality of the applications and expose sentitive user data if a malicious attacker were to exploit them. The recommended resolutions should be implemented immediately to fortify the application. </p>
    <p>Please note my services remain available for hire. I estimate two hour's time to resolve each vulnerability and perform sufficient QA testing of the change, as well as ten hour's time to perform any future comprehensive security assessments of the present application. Please contact me directly for rates. </p>
