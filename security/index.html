    <h1>Security Assessment of stark-castle-33112</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>My name is Michael Morscher, expert cybersecurity consultant specializing in penetration testing. I was hired by Jeremy Batchelder to perform an analysis of his Historic Landmarks program, consisting of a client-facing graphic interface and a server-side application with its own primitive interface. In this report, I will be researching and documenting security vulnerabilities in these applications, as well as providing recommendations to resolve them.</p>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>My testing methodology consisted of: </p>
    <li>"Black box" testing of the web interfaces to check for potential attacks</li>
    <li>Manual review of source code and subsequent "white box" testing of less obvious attacks</li>
    <li>Use of the curl tool for data transfer</li>
    <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
    <h3>Issues Found</h3>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
