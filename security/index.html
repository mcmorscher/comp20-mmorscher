    <h1>Security Assessment of stark-castle-33112</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>My name is Michael Morscher, expert cybersecurity consultant specializing in penetration testing. I was hired by Jeremy Batchelder to perform an analysis of his Historic Landmarks program, consisting of a client-facing graphic interface and a server-side application with its own primitive interface. In this report, I will be researching and documenting security vulnerabilities in these applications, as well as providing recommendations to resolve them.</p>
    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>My testing methodology consisted of: </p>
    <li>"Black box" testing of the web interfaces to check for potential attacks</li>
    <li>Manual review of source code and subsequent "white box" testing of less obvious attacks</li>
    <li>Use of the curl tool for data transfer</li>
    <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
    <h3>Issues Found</h3>

            <h4>Information Exposure</h4>
            <p>Location: stark-castle-33112.herokuapp.com/checkins.json</p>
            <p>Severity: Medium. The data being exposed through the checkins.json module is only the login, not any user passwords, but this is still a bad practice.</p>
            <p>Description: The issue was found during routine black box testing, following the specification of the module. To retrieve one's checkin data, they must enter their login via the query string, which then remains exposed. The information will remain in unsecured browser history and cache as well, representing a persistent threat.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Resolution: I recommend use of the HTTP POST method in place of using HTTP GET, which would allow entry of login through a form, and would allow processing of the response without exposing the login in the URL.</p>
