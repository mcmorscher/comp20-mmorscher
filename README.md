COMP 20 Fall 2017 Private Repo for Michael Morscher

##### Final Lab:

### What is this purpose of this Git repository?
  - This repository contains my assignments for COMP 20 this semester.
  
### What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
  - I really enjoyed Assignment 2, because learning Google maps is something very tangible and incredibly useful for making cool projects. Learning how to get things to actually work was stressful at times but I felt that I was able to really learn through the experience. The server side wihch I did through Assignment 3 was also quite interesting, but I found all the technicalities and required work-arounds to be not satsfying to do in practice.
  
### How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
  - I went from having no web development experience to being able to build non-trivial projects, which I think is quite a valuable transformation over the course of about three months. In terms of being able to speak about the work I completed, Assignments 2-4 were essentially different parts of one type of project, but learning the different parts was quite comprehensive and ultimately it was good to learn them in the context of the same project to see how everything fits together. I took COMP 20 wanting to learn how to make cool projects that can actually be shown off instead of run through a terminal, and I have now accepted a web-focused internship for next summer and am considering it as a career option, which is really cool. I can't say I'm passionate about every aspect of web development but it has been encouraging to have a different experience than the rest of the Tufts CS curriculum which I personally find to be pedagogically sound but practically worthless, and gaining this perspective among other things has allowed me to grow much more than from other classes.
  
### What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
  - Learning Git is something definitely worth the initial time investment. Having revision history available is something very useful when working on complex projects, and it has made the group project a lot more organized and comfortable than if we all had to sit at the same computer in Halligan, COMP 40 style. 
  
### Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
  - Web security is something that I didn't think I would find interesting, but I leave this course interested to learn more and become well-versed in an industry context.
